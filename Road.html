<body>
A bicycle specialized for high-speed riding on paved roads.<br>
 It is also called ‘cycle’ or ‘road’.<br>
 In general, it is equipped with large, thin wheels and drop bars and has no suspension,<br>
 so it is the closest bicycle to its original form, except for fixed gear bikes,<br>
 which are direct descendants of bicycle bicycles.<br>
 If compared to a car, it is equivalent to a sports car.<br>
